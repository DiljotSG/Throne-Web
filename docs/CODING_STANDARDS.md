# Coding Standards

Our coding standards consist of the following open guidelines.

- [Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/)
- [Redux Pattern for State Containment](https://redux.js.org/)


In addition, we follow the philosophy that all of our code should be
self-documenting: Comments are only to be used when necessary, not littered
in wherever.

These coding standards are enforced largely by eslint, which runs a check
after every pushed commit and disallows merging unless it passes.
